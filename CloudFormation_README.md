This readmefile provides a general guide on using CloudFormation templates to create Lambda functions. <br>
It goes without saying that the AWS Documentation is the best guide for using AWS resources. <br>
This guide loosely follows [this](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tutorial/How-to-Create-an-AWS-Lambda-Function-with-CloudFormation) blog article and [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html) AWS documentation. <br>

There are different ways to create Lambda functions using CloudFormation templates such as:
* Including the function code within the template (not discussed in this guide)
* Storing the function zip file in S3 bucket and then adding to the template
* Creating docker image of the function, uploading to ECR and adding image uri to the template

## Using Function Zip File
* Write the lambda function (refer to 'hello-lambda.py')
* Zip the function and upload the zip file to S3
* Create the yaml file for lambda function (explained below)
* Upload the template to CF stack

### CloudFormation Template for Lambda function
Refer to 'lambdafunc.yaml' for reference. <br>
There are two mandatory fields in the template which are:
* Code: Specifies the location of the code
* Role: Specifies the function's execution role

<b> Note: Runtime is also an important property that should be specified. <br> </b>

Apart from the above properties, you can specify other properties for more control over the function such as defining memory storage, ephemeral storage, timeout, etc. <br>

## Testing
After the template is uploaded to CloudFormation stack, the entire process of creating and configuring the function is automated.<br>
Once the stack execution is successful, head over to lambda console where the newly created function is available. <br>
Test the function to make sure the code runs correctly.
